# ForceEXPLoseOnDeath
A small Minecraft mod to make keepInventory players able to lose EXP.

This is the main branch, nothing will be here.
Please go to the [1.7.10 branch.](https://github.com/HRudyPlayZ/ForceEXPLoseOnDeath/tree/1.7.10)

###Will i port to other versions?
Maybe, maybe not. Depends on my motivation as i'm mainly a 1.7.10 player.
Do not ask for a version port, else i won't reply to you. The code is MIT-licensed and should be fairly easy to port
for someone that has the knowledge to how.
